To write a shell script to find the greatest among the given three numbers using command line arguments.


ALGORITHM:

1.	Start.
2.	Read the value of the three number in the command line.
3.	To find greatest integer among three number is calculated by 
If A is greater than B and C then    
4.	Print A is largest integer.
5.	Else B is greater than A and C
6.	Print  B is largest integer
7.	Else 
8.	Print C is largest integer
9.	If the input is not valid it prints invalid input.
10.	Stop.

SOURCE CODE:

read n1
read n2 
read n3
if [ #@ -le 3 ]
then
echo "command line arguments are missing"
elif [ $n1 -eq $n2 ]&& [ $n2 -eq $n3 ]
then
echo "All the three are equal"
elif [ $n1 -gt $n2 ]
then
if [ $n1 -gt $n3 ]
then
echo "$n1 is biggest number"
else
echo "$n3 is biggest number"
fi
elif [ $n2 -gt $3 ]
then
echo "$n2 is biggest number"
else
echo "$n3 is biggest number"
fi

OUTPUT:

msc@msc-Veriton-Series:$ ./greatest.sh
So n1 n2 n3
msc@msc-Veriton-Series:$ ./greatest.sh 4 6 3
6 is largest integer
msc@msc-Veriton-Series:$ ./greatest.sh  1 1 1
Invalid input

RESULT:

Thus, the above shell script found the greatest among the given three numbers using command line arguments.
